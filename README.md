# CoverShift

CoverShift helps small businesses find shift coverage, with manager approval before reassignment.

## Local setup

Install Node.js 24 or newer (includes npm), clone the shared repository when its URL is available, and open a terminal in the project folder.

```sh
npm start
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:3000. No third-party dependencies or installation step are needed for CS-001. For automatic restarts during development, use `npm run dev`.

Optional: copy `.env.example` to `.env` and change the port if 3000 is occupied. Keep `.env` out of Git. Stop the server with Ctrl+C.

## Current scope

CS-001 provides a local start page, server entry point, folder structure, environment example, and collaboration instructions. Authentication, dashboards, JSON persistence, and shift workflows will be implemented in later increments. The Node HTTP server is a minimal bootstrap; confirm the course's allowed backend stack before authentication work.

## Structure

- `public/`: browser-facing pages and future assets.
- `src/`: server code and future application services.
- `data/`: ignored runtime JSON storage, implemented in CS-003.
- `docs/`: implementation plan, collaboration rules, and AI log.

## Checks

Run `npm run check` to check server syntax. Start the app and verify the start page loads, refresh works, and an unknown path returns 404. This increment has no business logic requiring automated unit tests.

## Collaboration

See [the implementation plan](docs/implementation-plan.md) and [working agreement](docs/contributing.md). Each increment needs the user's visible review and explicit approval before pushing or merging. Shared repository: https://github.com/EldarSadeghi/soen287-covershift. Teammate access still needs verification.
